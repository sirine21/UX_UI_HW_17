                    <h1> Hello, I am Sirine Khaled</h1>
                    <p>A UX/UI Designer, fluent in English, Arabic, and French.
                        I create thoughtful and meaningful designs that cater to everyone. With a traditional background in Art History, i am fascinated by different cultures and how each person confronts problems uniquely based on their environment. Living in multiple countries, I have gained vast experience in human interaction, from food catering to medical services and, most recently, teaching art to children. I have loved each of these experiences, which inspired me to move these passions into the digital world of strategic design thinking. 
                        I create storyboards and journey maps with deep empathy for users because of my specialized background both in the United states and abroad.
                        Thanks for taking the time to view my work!
